# Predicting Boston Housing Prices
This repository contains a project for predicting Boston housing prices using machine learning techniques. The project is part of the **Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree**.
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to construct a predictive model that estimates the value of Boston houses. By exploring and analyzing the Boston housing dataset, we extract insights, identify trends, and ultimately train a model to predict housing prices with accuracy.
## Project Structure
The repository includes the following key files and directories:
- **boston_housing.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the code, explanations, and outputs.
- **housing.csv**: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **visuals.py**: Supplementary code for data visualization (if applicable).
## Key Concepts
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - Load the Boston housing dataset from `housing.csv`.
   - Display the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.
   - Identify data types, null values, and unique values for each column.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Separate the features (e.g., `RM`, `LSTAT`, `PTRATIO`) from the target variable (`MEDV`).
   - Handle any missing or anomalous data.
   
3. **Data Analysis**
   - Calculate key statistical metrics for the housing prices, including:
     - Minimum price
     - Maximum price
     - Mean price
     - Median price
     - Standard deviation
4. **Model Development**
   - Use machine learning models to predict housing prices.
   - Train, validate, and test the models to assess their accuracy and robustness.
## Requirements
To run the project, you will need the following Python libraries installed:
```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```
Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed to view and execute the notebook file.
## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/boston-housing.git
   cd boston-housing
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open and run the **boston_housing.ipynb** notebook.
## Results
The project provides insights into how features like `RM`, `LSTAT`, and `PTRATIO` impact housing prices. It also includes a trained predictive model capable of estimating the value of a house based on these features.
